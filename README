DESCRIPTION
    The Net::Amazon::ATS module allows you to use the Amazon Alexa Top Sites
    Service.

    The Alexa Top Sites Service (ATS) provides developers with programmatic
    access to the information Alexa Internet (www.alexa.com) collects from
    its Web Crawl, which currently encompasses more than 100 terabytes of
    data from over 4 billion Web pages. Developers and Web site owners can
    use AWIS as a platform for finding answers to difficult and interesting
    problems on the Web, and incorporating them into their Web applications.

    In order to access the Alexa Web Information Service, you will need an
    Amazon Web Services Subscription ID. See
    http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html

    Registered developers have free access to the Alexa Web Information
    Service during its beta period, but it is limited to 10,000 requests per
    subscription ID per day.

    There are some limitations, so be sure to read the The Amazon Alexa Top
    Sites Service FAQ.
